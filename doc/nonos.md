Things I won't implement
==========================

 * Memekey Support.

This is a ReiNAND only thing; get over it.

 * Loading firmware from sysnand.

IMHO, this is a bad idea for many reasons.

Corbenik is for people who know what they're doing first and foremost, so if getting a firmware is too hard, you're not the intended audience. Please use another CFW.


Not bugs
=========

 * CETK decryption

No, I can't fix this on a9lh. Here's how to do it; boot another CFW, go into system settings, then boot corbenik. You'll get the keys you need. This works with Cakes as well.

Another thing to know is only NATIVE_FIRM is required to boot, so you can boot Corbenik without AGB and TWL suceeding, reboot from settings and they'll decrypt.
