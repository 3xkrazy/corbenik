 * Optimize the code in svc. It's slow, because it checks the filesystem for 0xfe files that don't exist. It should list the dir instead.

Shortterm
-------------

 * Make config file for corbenik plaintext. Nobody likes binary configs. They suck. Massively. Especially when you fuck up a setting and need to change it on something that isn't a 3ds.
 * In place firmware loading/patching.
 * Weird hack central - Developer 11.4 leaked. Allow injecting debug module? Ehehehehe. No clue what the point of this would be, but hey, it'd be FUCKING cool, man.

Longterm
-------------
 * Attempt to create a replacement handler for Service 0x3D, AKA OutputDebugString(void const, int) to log to a file on SD.
   * Might be a pipe dream. It still would be cool to capture debug logs from games.
     * Pretty sure this goes over JTAG on PARTNER units and anything else >/dev/null.
 * Maybe replace svc 0xFF with something fancy.
 * Change some stdlib functions to more closely imitate their userland counterparts
 * EmuNAND. By this, I mean any non-physical NAND, not just gateway style.
   * I'd like to implement a loop-mount-like NAND. The NAND would be a file off the SD card rather than a region before partition 1 in this setup, and on the upside near unlimited NANDs could be accomodated without moving partitions. On the downside, any user stupid enough to move the NAND bin while the system is running would be in for severe consequences.
