Things I won't implement
==========================

 * Memekey Support.

This is a ReiNAND only thing; get over it. Use ReiNAND if you want memekey, or use memekey instead of the normal firmkey.

 * Loading firmware from sysnand.

IMHO, this is a bad idea for many reasons. It sounds great in theory; there's problems that hamper it from being truly a good idea.

I don't see this as a feature unless it's opt-in rather than opt-out or mandatory. If you're concerned about SD clutter; it's one folder, and everything IN THAT FOLDER IS IN FOLDERS. This is practically unix levels of organization, I don't think I can get more tidy.

 * Gateway launcher dat

Screw off. Need I explain why? Do it yourself. No support will be offered to gateway users. You're paying for a piracy tool. Seriously, why?

 * 3dsx

Get a9lh. Seriously. You might be able to use Brahma, but hell if I know. a9lh is the only supported method of running this, and no 3dsx launcher will be provided.

Not bugs
=========

 * CETK decryption

No, I can't fix this on a9lh. Here's how to do it; boot another CFW, go into system settings, then boot corbenik. You'll get the keys you need. This works with Cakes as well. After this, you'll never need a key again.

Another thing to know is only NATIVE_FIRM is required to boot, so you can boot Corbenik without AGB and TWL suceeding, reboot from settings and they'll decrypt if the CETK is there.
