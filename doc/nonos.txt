Things I won't implement (for a number of reasons)
==========================

 * Memekey Support.

This is a ReiNAND only thing; get over it. Use ReiNAND if you want memekey, or use memekey instead of the normal firmkey.

 * Loading firmware from sysnand.

IMHO, this is a bad idea for many reasons. It sounds great in theory; there's problems that hamper it from being truly a good idea.

I don't see this as a feature unless it's opt-in rather than opt-out or mandatory. If you're concerned about SD clutter; it's one folder, and everything IN THAT FOLDER IS IN FOLDERS. This is practically unix levels of organization, I don't think I can get more tidy.

 * Gateway launcher dat

Screw off. Do it yourself. No support will be offered to gateway users. You're paying for a piracy tool. Not to mention, I only integrate code I'm capable of testing safely, so this won't ever be a part of corbenik.

 * 3dsx

You might be able to use Brahma, but hell if I know. Either way, I'm not going to attempt to get stuff on menuhax since there's limits on version now. I recommend any menuhax users get a9lh.

Not bugs
=========

 * CETK decryption

This has been removed from the FIRM decryptor, since it's unreliable on a9lh. I may re-add it someday.
